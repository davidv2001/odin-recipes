    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      You can make this lovely, sweet treat for 4th July or any patriotic
      holiday without turning on the oven! Besides the taste and light
      mousse-like texture, I think your guests will enjoy the iconic stars and
      stripes design provided by the fresh blueberries and strawberries.
    </p>

      <li>
        Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa powder, and melted
        butter in a bowl until mixture is thoroughly combined and crumbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer crust mixture to a 9x11-inch baking dish. Press crust into
        bottom of dish until smooth and even. Cover dish with plastic wrap and
        refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cream cheese and mascarpone cheese in a bowl until thoroughly
        combined. Stir in lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract into
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1/3 cup sugar into whipping cream in a separate metal or glass
        bowl until the cream is fluffy and forms soft peaks. Add whipped cream
        to the cream cheese mixture and gently whisk until filling is soft,
        fluffy, and well combined.
